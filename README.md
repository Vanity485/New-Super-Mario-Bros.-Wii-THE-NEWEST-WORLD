This was designed to be played with one player, but you can still play with up to four. This hack changes all the levels, coin battle stages, and even the enemy ambushes! You must play this in Dolphin Emulator. You can then use the “open” button to load it! Once it’s loaded up, you’re ready to play! Good Luck!
Some additional information needed for this.
I like strawberries
I like the number 4

This was meant for 1 player, but up to 4 is supported.
This is my first ROM hack
This took forever to make
Only supports Wii Remotes, but, if you can map a PlayStation or XBOX controller, that works too. Thank you for installing New Super Mario Bros. Wii: THE NEWEST WORLD!
Best of luck!  -Vanity485
